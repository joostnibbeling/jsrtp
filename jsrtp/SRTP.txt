ROC:
	- 32-bit
	- Number of times sequences number has been reset to 0
	- SRTP index:
		- 48 bit
		- 2^16 * ROC + SEQ

s_1: 
	- Receiver only
	- 16 bit
	- highest received RTP sequence number
	
- Encryption algorithm (cipher + operation mode)
- Authentication algorithm
- n_e: session key length for encryption
- n_a: session key length for authentication

- Replay list
	- Receiver only
	- Recently received and authenticated

- MKI indicator

- MKI Len (in octets)

- Current active MKI
	- Sender only
	
- Master keys
	- Counter number of packets
	- Optional
		- Master salt
		- Key derivation rate (power of 2)
		- MKI value
		- <From, To> values
		
- SRTCP:
	- No rollover and s_1 value
	- Separate replay list
	- Separate counter
	
Sender procedure
	- Determine cryptographic context
	- Determine index
	- Determine master key and salt (with index or mki)
	- Determine session keys and salt:
		- Master key
		- Master salt
		- Key derivation rate
		- Session key lengths
	- Encrypt RTP
		- Encryption algorithm
		- Session encryption key
		- Session salt
		- Index
	- If MKI indicator is set to one, append MKI
	- Compute authentication tag and append
		- ROC
		- Authenication algorithm
		- Session authentication Key
	- Update ROC
